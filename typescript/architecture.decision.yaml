  # {{main.title}}

  * Status: proposed
  * {{#main.is_important}}MUST-HAVE.{{/main.is_important}}{{#main.is_urgent}}URGENT.{{/main.is_urgent}}
  * Deciders: {{deciders}}

  ## Context and Problem Statement

  {{#main.is_vague}}
  * At the moment, part of the problem is still vague and will hopefully be clarified over time.
  {{/main.is_vague}}

  ## Decision Drivers

  {{#main.is_experimental}}
  * There is no obvious solution for this problem, and we should assume an experimental approach.
  {{/main.is_experimental}}
  {{#main.is_quick_and_dirty}}
  * Prefer a quick implementation. The speed of development is more important for this problem that the quality of the solution.
  {{/main.is_quick_and_dirty}}
  {{#main.is_support_friendly}}
  * Should make support as friendly as possible. In other words, logging should be sufficient to quickly narrow down issues.
  {{/main.is_support_friendly}}
  {{#main.has_monitoring}}
  * Should publish monitoring metrics. These metrics would probably be analyzed in real time, most likely on a dashboard, by a support team.
  {{/main.has_monitoring}}
  {{#main.has_telemetry}}
  * Should publish user telemetry. These metrics should help improve the user experience over time.
  {{/main.has_telemetry}}
  {{#main.is_i18n}}
  * Should make it simple to provide a translation in different languages.
  {{/main.is_i18n}}
  {{#main.has_port}}
  * Should be easy to port to different programming languages.
  {{/main.has_port}}
  {{#main.is_accessible}}
  * Should be accessible to people with different access requirements.
  {{/main.is_accessible}}
  {{#main.is_theme_friendly}}
  * Should make it possible to support different visual themes.
  {{/main.is_theme_friendly}}
  {{#main.is_moving_target}}
  * Should accommodate a moving business target.
  {{/main.is_moving_target}}
  {{#main.has_privacy}}
  * Should ensure data privacy.
  {{/main.has_privacy}}
  {{#main.has_data_accountancy}}
  * Should ensure that data is not corrupted.
  {{/main.has_data_accountancy}}
  {{#main.has_data_contract}}
  * Should ensure a data contract.
  {{/main.has_data_contract}}
  {{#main.has_scalability}}
  * Should scale.
  {{/main.has_scalability}}
